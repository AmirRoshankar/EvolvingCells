A simulation of randomly evolving cell in an environment with limited food.
Here is a short demo:

# Get started
To start the program, run the evolvingCells.jar file. Adjust the initial settings, when prompted, to customize the simulation. The cells are represented by red circles, and the food is represented by black circles. Recommended frame size is approximately 500.

# Mutation
Cells mutate to vary slightly from their parents every time they are spawned. This casuses the most fit cells to survive and pass down their traits to their off-spring.
